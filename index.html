                            <p>The project focuses on utilizing deep learning techniques to analyze chest X-ray 
                                images of patients. The objective is to develop a computer vision model capable of 
                                accurately classifying these images into one of three categories: benign, pneumonia, or Covid-19.

                                To achieve this, popular frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras are employed 
                                for training the model. Once the model is trained, it is deployed using TF-serving 
                                and Flask, allowing it to be accessed and utilized in a user-friendly manner.

                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Computer Vision, Image Analysis, TensorFlow, Keras, Deep Learning, Docker</div>
                            <p>In my deep learning project, I focused on analyzing patients' chest X-ray images 
                                to develop a computer vision model capable of predicting the images into three 
                                distinct classes: benign, pneumonia, or Covid-19. To accomplish this, I utilized 
                                popular frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras for model training, TF-serving 
                                and Flask for model deployment, and Docker for containerization. By leveraging 
                                these frameworks, I ensured efficient and robust development, deployment, and 
                                scalability of the model.<br><br>

                                Additionally, I embarked on an anthropometric analysis of the human face, 
                                which plays a crucial role in craniofacial plastic and reconstructive surgeries. 
                                Factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, environment, and 
                                region influence facial anthropometrics. Plastic surgeons rely on the anatomical 
                                dimensions of facial structures for repairing and reconstructing facial deformities. 
                                These dimensions, along with cultural, personality, and ethnic background factors, 
                                significantly contribute to facial appearance and aesthetics, with eye appearance 
                                and symmetry being particularly influential.<br><br>
                                
                                In this project, my objective was to build a model capable of scanning an image 
                                of a patient's eye and accurately predicting their gender as male or female. 
                                To achieve this, I employed the ResNet50 pre-trained model as the foundation 
                                of my deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN model was 
                                trained using a dataset of 7,377 images belonging to the two gender classes 
                                and validated with an additional 1,843 images (20%) from the same classes.<br><br>
                                
                                To optimize the model's performance, I fine-tuned various parameters 
                                such as learning rate, inner layer size, and dropout rate. The resulting 
                                model achieved an impressive validation accuracy of 97.3%, with precision, 
                                recall, and area under the curve metrics reaching approximately 96%. To ensure 
                                ease of deployment and utilization, I converted the best model into a 
                                TensorFlow Lite model.
                                
                                For enhanced reproducibility and scalability, I deployed the project 
                                code within a Docker container. This containerization approach encapsulates 
                                the necessary dependencies, libraries, and the trained model, enabling seamless 
                                deployment across different systems and environments. I have made the project 
                                code available on GitHub, fostering collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and 
                                further advancements in the field.
                                
                                Through these projects, I demonstrate my proficiency in leveraging 
                                cutting-edge technologies and methodologies in machine learning and 
                                computer vision, as well as my expertise in deploying models using Docker containers.

                            <p>The treatment options and outcomes for benign and malignant cancer differ significantly. Benign cancers are 
                                generally not life-threatening and can often be managed through surgery alone. On the other hand, 
                                malignant cancers pose a greater risk to life and typically necessitate a combination of 
                                treatment approaches, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. 
                                Accurate identification of the cancer type is essential for developing an effective 
                                treatment plan and improving the likelihood of a successful outcome.<br><br>

                                In this collaborative project, our aim is to train a deep learning model that can classify 
                                patients into two categories: benign or malignant cancer. The model leverages a dataset 
                                comprising over 9000 ultrasound images of both malignant and benign breast cancer cases. 
                                To achieve this, we employed pretrained neural networks for training and 
                                subsequently deployed the model to Dockerhub for ease of access and utilization.

                    <p>
                        My diverse interests span across a wide range of fascinating domains, igniting my passion 
                        for sharing knowledge in scientific and programming realms. As an avid consumer of 
                        educational podcasts and documentaries, I immerse myself in the latest advancements 
                        and cutting-edge technologies that shape our world.

                        I am an avid reader of articles and blogs that delve into emerging technologies, 
                        delving into the intricate intersections of business, socioeconomics, and 
                        geopolitics. Engaging in thought-provoking discussions with friends stimulates 
                        my intellectual curiosity, and we often embark on thrilling excursions, 
                        exploring new places, engaging in friendly banter, and indulging in spirited gaming sessions.

                        When I'm not immersed in the digital realm, I seek solace in the great outdoors. 
                        Hiking and walking through scenic landscapes provide me with moments of tranquility, 
                        allowing my mind to wander and recharge. This holistic balance between tech-driven 
                        pursuits and nature's serenity fuels my passion for continuous learning and exploration.
